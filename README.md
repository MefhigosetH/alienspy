# AlienSpy basic malware analysis

This paper will discuss a basic malware analysis exercise performed on an AlienSpy (seen in the wild) sample.

## Background

Natalio Alberto Nisman (5 December 1963 â€“ 18 January 2015) was an Argentine lawyer who worked as a federal prosecutor, noted for being the chief investigator of the 1994 car bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people, the worst terrorist attack in Argentina's history. On 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead at his home in Buenos Aires.

There are proofs that he was targeted, a few days before his dead, by invasive spy software downloaded onto his cellular phone and PC shortly before his mysterious death. The software masqueraded as a confidential document and was intended to infect a Windows computer.
